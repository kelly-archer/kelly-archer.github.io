    <p>Untitled and Dispossessed, an artistic-activist mapping project of one highway intersection in Santa Cruz, CA, tells a story of how the property-less—those without leases or titles to land—are reduced to waste and effectively dispossessed of home, dignity, and humanity. Environmental waste (including highway pollution, light industry smog and particulate matter, consumer discards, and wildfire atmospheric toxicity) plays a leading role. The city’s waste (mis)management practices, in failing to extend adequate sanitation services to the houseless, produce geographies of organized abandonment (with high rates of BIPOC). Policing and vigilantism collapse waste and racialized bodies in expressions of eco-fascism, built on colonial legacies of white supremacy in one of the highest cost-of-living cities in the US (where original Indigenous inhabitants cannot afford to live even nearby). We tell this story of stories through conversations, sound clips, documentary photos, drawings, GIS mapping, and political analysis, in order to imagine—and begin to realize—an emancipatory future.</p>
